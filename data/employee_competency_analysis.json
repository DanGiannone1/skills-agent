    "thought_process": "Hank Hill's existing cloud skills and project history provide a limited but clear picture of his expertise. His cloud skills include programming languages like Python and C, agile methodologies, and communication engineering, which align with general technical and project management competencies. His project history includes work on DXC-IBM AS/400, which is a specific technical competency. However, his certifications are currently empty, which limits the ability to map additional competencies directly from certifications. Comparing his skills and project history to the company's approved competencies list, it is evident that he is missing many competencies that could be inferred from his skills and project involvement. For example, his programming skills could align with competencies like DXC-PROGRAMMING (PYTHON, PYSPARK, SQL), and his work on DXC-IBM AS/400 directly maps to the DXC-IBM JD EDWARDS CONFIGURABLE NETWORK COMPUTING (CNC) - AS/400 competency. Additionally, his agile methodologies expertise could align with DXC-SCALED AGILE FRAMEWORK (SAFE).",
